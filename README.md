The G.O.D. Project
========================

Greater Organism Design.

We are the 99% of the world. How come we only do choices once per very few often and
only that small set of people takes all the decisions.

Quoting occupymontreal.tk "We are students, workers, unemployed, families, young,
retired, public service employees, lawyers, nurses, grand-parents, security gards,
construction workers, of all nationalities, your children’s teachers, atheists,
christians, muslims, buddhists, jedis and artists."

This project is done by passionnate people who happens to be web developpers. We
use open-source software and want this to happen.

devLAB Montreal is a small organization of web developpers who are passionnate about
their craft and we provide the infrastructure and the maintenance of the online system.






How this will work?
========================

This is the first iteration.

The whole idea is to take action and propose viable solutions to real society problems.

The application ask questions and suggests two solutions, voter choose his favourite.
The application calculate the most favourited solution.

If you want to propose new solutions, the forum at http://godproject.devlabmtl.org/discussions/ will take
your suggestions, people can add comments and at some point, moderators could modify
questions from the forum.



WHAT WE NEED?
========================
* Suggest the most important issue you want to fix
* Propose three to five viable (short) solutions (per issue)
* Discuss about them on http://godproject.devlabmtl.org/discussions/
* Let us do the rest.
