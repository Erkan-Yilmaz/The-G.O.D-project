The G.O.D. Project - Introduction
=================================

G.O.D stands for Greater Organism Design.

Problem
-------

We are 99% of the whole world. How come we do choices once a blue moon and then let only that small amount of people to make all the decisions? It's time to awake social consciousness.

Proposed Solution
-----------------

G.O.D. main purpose it's to be able to get everybody's issue and let the government, our executives, take **Informed** actions. For the time being this might evolve to something other than weblog, social network or forum.

This is meant to become non-centralized. Cities could start their polling sessions
by themselves, results grids will be populated. Moderator will populate and collect
the questions and the suggestions.

Quoting occupymontreal.tk "We are students, workers, unemployed, families, young,
retired, public service employees, lawyers, nurses, grand-parents, security guards,
construction workers, of all nationalities, your children’s teachers, atheists,
christians, muslims, buddhists, jedis and artists."

Contributors
------------

This project is done by passionate people who happens to be web developers. We
use open-source software to build a tool to get people's opinion on issues
that matters to them.

**devLAB Montreal** is the initiator group and we welcome any web developer who want
to contribute we, at devLAB Montréal, will take care of the hosting and the code base.

How this will work? Technically - Overview
========================

This is the first iteration, so don't expect too much about it.

Since the whole idea is to take action and propose viable solutions to real society problems we thought that, basically:

* The application will ask questions and suggests two solutions, voter choose his favorite.
* The application calculate the most favorite solution.

If you want to propose new solutions, the forum at http://godproject.devlabmtl.org/discussions/ will take
your suggestions, people can add comments and at some point, moderators could modify
questions from the forum.

WHAT WE NEED? - Ideas, concepts
========================

* Suggest the most important issue you want to fix
* Propose three to five viable (short) solutions (per issue)
* Discuss about them on http://godproject.devlabmtl.org/discussions/
* Let us do the rest.

Commit code? - How to contribute
========================

You code? In what is this built on.

* PHP 5.3
* Symfony 2 as the polling engine
* Git hosted on Git hub for source control
* Vanilla forum as the discussion engine

Commit your code proposal on the https://github.com/siegfried1e/The-G.O.D-project on the develop
branch.

Official version is hosted on http://godproject.devlabmtl.org/, we take care of the deployment
and scaling issues whenever they come.

Proposing new questions and solutions is supported on the forum http://godproject.devlabmtl.org/discussions/

You need to know about Git (http://progit.org/book/), and Symfony 2 (http://symfony.com/).

It's too early in the project to explain how technically we will have a distributed database 
system, but let's start somewhere, the wiki is there to sketch the concepts and the model.

Go ahead!

Help with Quality?
========================

Explain all found bugs on our bug tracker:

https://github.com/siegfried1e/The-G.O.D-project/issues

An efficient way to do so:

* Subject is a 10 words summary of what failed
* Description should contain short description of the bug
* Steps to reproduce
* Web address where the problem was found
